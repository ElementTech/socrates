# ðŸ›¤ Steps Flows

Steps Flow is a pipeline of one or more [Instances](../instances/) arranged in Steps. They share ENV Variables ([parameters](../parameters/)) and Outputs to the next Steps. It has its own execution history and can be drilled down to individual Instances.

Drag & Drop (Instances) to your flow in a specific Step. They can be arranged and Dragged back to be removed. You can also add or remove entire steps.

Also Choose an Error behaviour:

* Continue - Ignore Errors
* Stop - Stop next steps

The Run Page has the following capabilities:

* Job execution history
* Click on each instance in step to show console log or go to the instance run page of that specific run.
* Overriding specific parameters for your next executions.
* [Scheduling](../scheduler.md) with current chosen parameters.
