# ðŸŽ² Instances

An Instance is attached to a [Block](../projects.md). It is essentially a [Parameterized](../parameters/) [Block](../projects.md), with its own execution History. Multiple Instance can exist for the same [Block](../projects.md). It can be run individually, inside a [Flow](../flows/) or be [scheduled](../scheduler.md).

## Creating an Instance <a href="#creating-a-block" id="creating-a-block"></a>

Go to `/instance/create/`

Wait for [Dynamic Parameters](../parameters/dynamic.md) to finish rendering. Choose any [Multi-Choice](../parameters/) and [Dynamic Parameters](../parameters/dynamic.md) as Defaults for your Instance.
