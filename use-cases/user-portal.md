# ðŸšª User Portal

The User Portal is a special view. It is essentially a Task Explorer with links to Components in the Server. It can be used to allow non-technical users to access specific jobs and use them, or organize the Components in the server in a way that is easy to understand. Click the **+** button to add a link or a folder.
